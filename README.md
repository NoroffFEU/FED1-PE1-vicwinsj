# FED1 Project Exam 1

When I first started this exam project I was excited and eager to learn how to make a website with blog post functionality. I started setting up a project board and deciding which fictional client I was supposed to create the site for. Unfortunately I got sick the following week with an angina, and therefore I lost 2â€“3 weeks of the exam period. I got demotivated as a result, especially after facing some quite frustrating issues making a responsive menu using javascript. I got into a negative spiral of thought and started thinking that I maybe had to do a resit, but I managed to get back some faith again with the help of a friend. The extension of the deadline with one week because of my illness helped me make a go for it, and I'm proud of the result considering how far from finishing I was just a week ago.

The roadmap of my project board could have been more structured if I didn't get sick, but also I did in fact not know all the issues that would be necessary to meet the exam brief. So there are quite a few issues that I quickly did on the go as I faced them, without noting them down in the project board. I figured that would have slowed down the momentum I needed to get the project done before deadline.
