This project aimed to put into practice the skills (including design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript) I learnt the first year at the Front-end Development program at Noroff. I was to demonstrate my ability to interpret a brief, plan a solution, design a user interface, build and test a responsive web application.

## Description

According to the brief I was hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client had asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. The client required admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts.

The following API endpoints were required to complete this project:

· GET /blog/posts/<name>

· GET /blog/posts/<name>/<id>

· PUT /blog/posts/<name>/<id>

· DELETE /blog/posts/<name>/<id>

· POST /auth/register

· POST /auth/login

## Built With
